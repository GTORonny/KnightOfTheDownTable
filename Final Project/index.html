    <h2>By Aaron Webb</h2>
    <p>I created this story because I've sorta fallen in love with the idea of telling stories through programming. When I made my we development assignment it was frustrating but the actually creative part were incredibly fun. Their isn't a political or emotional reason that I created this. I mostly just wanted to immerse someone in a interesting story for however long they decide to stay on the page.</p>
