		<h1>Even the Town Fool gets Lucky</h1>

		<p>You call out to the bard to play a tune and throw him a silver coin. You sing and dance around the bar much to the annoyance of all the others in attendance. The woman seems entertained so you decide to escalate your performace. You hop onto the bar and begin to try to juggle the mugs. The woman begins to giggle so you don't see a wet spot on the counter. You slip dropping all the mugs and knocking yourself out. When you awake the woman is gone and you've been thrown out the bar.</p>

		<p>Count yourself lucky that you weren't hurt or worse. 

		FAIR ENDING
