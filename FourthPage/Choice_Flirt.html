		<h1>A Silvertongue Leaves A Bitter Taste</h1>

		<p>You stumble up to the fair lady and offer to by her a drink. She smiles and then a look of shock come across her face. Two of your fellow knights have stepped into the bar and one strikes you across the head with the hilt of his axe. You were so drunk that you didn't notice the woman you were flirting with was the kings daughter. You are brought to the back room of the bar and swiftly excuted.</p>

		<p>If her looks could kill you'd have died several times over instead of once.
